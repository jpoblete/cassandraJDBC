# client
Simple Cassandra client using the DataStax Driver ffor Apache Cassandra

This is meant to be a build to test behaviors on the driver
In order to build you need to have git installed and execute:

git clone git@github.com:jpoblete/simple-client.git

Then open the project with IntelliJ Idea and build the project
A runnable JAR will be created on the project directory

Simple as that!

Constructive critique is always welcome
